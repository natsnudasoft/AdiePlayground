# Facade

The Facade pattern is a design pattern which provides a simplified interface to a larger body of
code that can make the code easier to use.

The Facade pattern is used when interactions between subsystems are complex, or rely on a large
number of dependencies; the Facade pattern can provide a simple view of the complex interactions
that are most common. If needed, advanced customisation for clients that want it can still be made
available via the subsystems that the Facade wraps.
